Key Strengths:
- Novel statistical methods for detecting Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) while controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR).
- Significant contribution to the field of A/B testing, addressing a critical gap in existing methodologies.
- Practical tools for practitioners, enhancing the rigor of experimental design.
- Clear comparison between naive approaches and proposed methods, highlighting limitations of traditional methods.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Lack of detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed methods, particularly regarding their assumptions and potential biases.
- Insufficient emphasis on the novelty of contributions in the introduction.

Recommendation:
The paper is publishable due to its significant contributions to the field of A/B testing and the introduction of novel methods that address critical gaps in existing methodologies. However, to enhance its scientific rigor and impact, the authors should include a more detailed discussion on the limitations of their proposed methods, particularly focusing on assumptions and potential biases. Additionally, the introduction should more explicitly emphasize the novelty of the contributions to ensure readers fully appreciate the advancements being made. Addressing these points will provide a more balanced view and strengthen the paper's case for publication in a reputable journal.
