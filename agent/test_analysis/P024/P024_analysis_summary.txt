Key Strengths:
- Introduction of FLIP, a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism, which is a significant advancement in machine learning security.
- Addresses a critical gap in the literature by focusing on label-only attacks, a previously underexplored area.
- Thorough methodology with systematic evaluation across various datasets and model architectures.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Insufficient exploration of existing literature on label-only attacks, which affects the contextualization of the paper's contributions.
- Lack of detailed statistical analysis, which may raise questions about the rigor and reproducibility of the findings.

Recommendation:
The paper is publishable due to its novel contribution to the field of machine learning security and its thorough methodology. However, to enhance its impact and address critical weaknesses, the authors should consider the following improvements before publication: 1) Expand the literature review to include a more comprehensive discussion of existing work on label-only attacks, thereby better contextualizing the paper's contributions. 2) Provide a clearer explanation of the statistical methods used in the analysis to strengthen the rigor and reproducibility of the findings. These enhancements will solidify the paper's foundation and increase its value to the research community.
