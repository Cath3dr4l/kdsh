- Unsubstantiated claims without rigorous evidence or theoretical framework.
- Flawed methodology relying on whimsical elements.
- Absence of empirical evidence or structured experimental design.
- Convoluted presentation obscuring main arguments.

Recommendation:
The paper is not publishable in its current form due to significant issues with coherence, clarity, and scientific rigor. To improve, the authors should focus on establishing a clear and logical connection between the interdisciplinary elements and the core research objectives. They should provide empirical evidence or a well-defined theoretical framework to support their claims. The methodology needs to be revised to adhere to scientific standards, eliminating whimsical elements and ensuring a structured experimental design. Additionally, the writing style should be straightforward, with clear definitions and logical progression of ideas to enhance accessibility and impact. Addressing these issues could significantly improve the paper's publishability.
