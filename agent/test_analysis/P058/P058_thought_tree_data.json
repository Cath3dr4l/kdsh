      "content": "The paper introduces a novel application of positional encoding to RNNs, which is a significant contribution to the field of deep learning. This innovation challenges the conventional understanding that RNNs do not require positional encoding, thereby expanding the theoretical framework of RNNs. The experimental results support this claim, showing improved performance in handling large vocabularies with low-frequency tokens. This novelty and relevance enhance the paper's publishability, as it addresses a gap in the literature regarding the utility of positional encoding in RNNs.",
