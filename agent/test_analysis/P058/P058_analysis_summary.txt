Key Strengths:
- Novel application of positional encoding to RNNs, challenging conventional understanding.
- Empirical evidence showing enhanced RNN performance, especially with large vocabularies and gradient instability.
- Potential for significant impact on future research in NLP and time series analysis.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Lack of explicit connections between experimental results and theoretical implications.

Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for publication due to its innovative contributions and potential impact on the field. However, to enhance clarity and reader comprehension, it is suggested that the authors provide more explicit connections between their experimental results and the theoretical implications discussed. This will help readers better understand the significance of the findings and the reasoning behind them. Addressing this weakness will strengthen the paper's overall argument and accessibility.
