Key Strengths:
- Novel approach to AMR parsing using Stack-LSTMs.
- Competitive results without relying on external tools or additional resources.
- Addresses a gap in the literature by reducing dependency on pre-calculated features.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Lack of detailed comparison with existing methods.
- Insufficient discussion on limitations compared to pipeline systems.
- Need for more comprehensive statistical analysis of results.

Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for publication due to its novel approach and significant contributions to the field of natural language processing. However, to enhance its impact and scientific rigor, the authors should consider the following improvements: 1) Provide a more detailed comparison with existing AMR parsing methods, including a discussion on the limitations of their approach compared to pipeline systems. 2) Include a comprehensive statistical analysis of the results, such as confidence intervals or significance testing, to validate the claims about the parser's performance. These enhancements will strengthen the paper's claims and provide a clearer context for its contributions.
