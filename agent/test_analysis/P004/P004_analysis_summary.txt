Key Strengths:
- Introduction of a novel concept of training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs).
- Innovative use of labels as features (LaF) enhancing representational capacity.
- Empirical results showing TFGNNs outperform traditional GNNs.
- Rigorous methodology with formal proofs and propositions.
- Well-structured experimental design using standard datasets.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Lack of comprehensive discussion on limitations and potential applications.
- TFGNNs' inapplicability to inductive settings and challenges with heterophilous graphs.

Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for publication due to its novel contributions and rigorous methodology. However, to enhance its impact and provide a balanced view, it is suggested that the authors expand the discussion on the limitations of TFGNNs, particularly their inapplicability to inductive settings and challenges with heterophilous graphs. Additionally, suggesting future research directions could further strengthen the paper's contribution to the field.
