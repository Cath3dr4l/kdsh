Key Strengths:
- Novel approach to improving model generalization in semantic segmentation.
- Significant empirical improvements in accuracy across various datasets.
- Addresses the challenge of out-of-distribution data without modifying training or architecture.
- Rigorous and well-structured methodology with a comprehensive evaluation protocol.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Lack of detailed discussion on the limitations of the self-adaptive approach, particularly regarding computational efficiency and trade-offs in real-time applications.

Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for publication due to its novel and effective contribution to the field of semantic segmentation. The introduction of a self-adaptive inference mechanism that enhances model generalization is a significant advancement, supported by strong empirical results. However, to further strengthen the paper, it is recommended that the authors include a more detailed discussion on the limitations of their approach, specifically focusing on computational efficiency and potential trade-offs in real-time applications. This addition would provide a more balanced perspective on the applicability of the proposed method and address any concerns regarding its practical implementation.
