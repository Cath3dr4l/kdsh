While this innovative perspective could attract interest from a diverse audience, it also raises concerns about scientific rigor. The use of unconventional methods, particularly those like tarot cards and astrological charts, may undermine the credibility of the research. To enhance publishability, the authors should provide a robust justification for these methods, demonstrating their relevance and scientific basis in the context of marine ecology.",

However, some claims, particularly the correlation between microbial community composition and local cuisine, lack empirical support and could be perceived as overstatements. This raises questions about the validity of the conclusions drawn from the data. Strengthening the paper's publishability would require the authors to ensure that all claims are substantiated by robust data and to provide a thorough discussion of the implications of their findings, avoiding any exaggeration that could compromise scientific integrity.",

While creativity in research is commendable, the lack of clarity regarding how these methods contribute to the scientific inquiry may lead to confusion and skepticism among readers. To improve the paper's coherence and clarity, the authors should clearly articulate the rationale behind these methods and how they enhance the understanding of marine genomic diversity.

    "recommendation": "The paper presents innovative ideas and significant findings, particularly in the discovery of marine extremophiles and the integration of genomic sequencing with novel methodologies. However, the paper currently lacks the necessary scientific rigor due to insufficient statistical analysis and the use of unconventional methods that are not empirically grounded. To improve publishability, the authors should: 1) Provide robust statistical evidence to support all claims, especially those related to microbial community composition and local cuisine. 2) Strengthen the scientific basis of their methodologies by focusing on empirically validated approaches and removing or justifying the use of unconventional methods like tarot cards and astrological charts. By addressing these critical weaknesses, the paper could significantly enhance its contribution to the field and meet the standards required for publication."
