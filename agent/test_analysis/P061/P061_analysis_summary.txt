Key Strengths:
- Novel approach in contrastive learning by incorporating the original image into the training process.
- Empirical results show consistent improvements across multiple datasets and tasks.
- Clear comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques, showcasing a 5.1% improvement over MoCo-v2 on ImageNet-1K.
- Well-articulated and empirically validated methodology.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Lack of statistical analysis such as confidence intervals or significance testing to support claims.

Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for publication due to its novel contributions and substantial improvements in the field of self-supervised learning. The methodological innovation of incorporating the original image into the training process is well-supported by empirical evidence, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods. However, to enhance the scientific rigor and robustness of the conclusions, it is recommended that the authors include more statistical analysis of the results, such as confidence intervals or significance testing. This addition would strengthen the claims of superiority and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness.
