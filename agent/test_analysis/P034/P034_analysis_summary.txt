Key Strengths:
- Novel contribution to Vision Transformers with Dual PatchNorm (DPN) approach.
- Consistent performance improvements across various tasks and datasets.
- Rigorous and well-structured methodology with extensive testing.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Lack of detailed discussion on theoretical implications of DPN compared to existing techniques.
- Insufficient statistical analyses and confidence intervals to support findings.

Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for publication due to its novel contribution to the field of Vision Transformers and the demonstrated effectiveness of the Dual PatchNorm (DPN) approach. The consistent improvements across various tasks and datasets highlight the significance of the work. However, to further strengthen the paper, it is recommended that the authors include a more detailed discussion on the theoretical implications of DPN, particularly in comparison to existing normalization techniques in terms of computational efficiency and scalability. Additionally, providing more detailed statistical analyses and confidence intervals would enhance the robustness of the conclusions. Addressing these points would solidify the paper's contribution and impact.
