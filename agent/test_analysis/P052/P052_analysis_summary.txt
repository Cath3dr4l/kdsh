Key Strengths:
- Introduction of the Alpha Discovery Neural Network (ADNN) as a novel approach to financial feature extraction.
- Significant methodological innovation addressing limitations of traditional genetic programming methods.
- Empirical results demonstrating ADNN's superior performance in generating informative features.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Lack of detailed comparison with a broader range of contemporary feature extraction methods beyond genetic programming.

Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for publication due to its significant contributions to the field of quantitative trading through the introduction of the Alpha Discovery Neural Network (ADNN). The methodological innovation and empirical results are strong indicators of its impact. However, to enhance the paper's rigor and provide a clearer context for the advantages of ADNN, it is recommended that the authors include a more comprehensive comparison with a wider range of contemporary feature extraction methods. This addition would strengthen the paper's argument and provide a more robust validation of ADNN's effectiveness.
