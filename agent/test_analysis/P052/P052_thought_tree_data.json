      "content": "The methodology employed in the paper is robust, utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the Chinese A-share stock market and a well-structured experimental design. The authors have clearly defined their metrics for success and provided thorough experimental results that support their claims. However, the paper could benefit from a more rigorous statistical analysis of the results, including confidence intervals or significance testing, to bolster the validity of their findings. Additionally, a clearer explanation of the model's limitations and potential biases in the data would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the research, which are critical factors for publishability.",

However, certain sections, particularly the related work and conclusion, could be expanded to provide a more comprehensive context for the research findings. A deeper engagement with existing literature and a more robust discussion of the implications of the findings would enhance the overall impact and relevance of the paper. Furthermore, addressing potential ethical concerns related to automated trading strategies and their implications on market dynamics would add depth to the discussion and align the paper with current trends in responsible AI research.",

The methodological innovation and empirical results are strong indicators of its impact. However, to enhance the paper's rigor and provide a clearer context for the advantages of ADNN, it is recommended that the authors include a more comprehensive comparison with a wider range of contemporary feature extraction methods. This addition would strengthen the paper's argument and provide a more robust validation of ADNN's effectiveness."
