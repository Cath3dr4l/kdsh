Key Strengths:
- Novel approach to online learning through Online Ensembles of Basis Expansions (OEBEs)
- Addresses critical gap in adaptability and performance of Gaussian processes in online settings
- Empirical results show OEBEs outperform traditional methods across various datasets
- Significant contribution to Bayesian machine learning and online inference

Critical Weaknesses:

Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for publication due to its significant contributions to the field of online learning and Bayesian machine learning. The introduction of Online Ensembles of Basis Expansions (OEBEs) provides a novel and effective solution to the limitations of existing methods, particularly Random Fourier Feature (RFF) approximations. The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of OEBEs over traditional methods, highlighting their potential for practical applications in real-time data processing. The paper is well-organized and clearly presents its theoretical foundations and implications, making it a valuable addition to the literature. No critical weaknesses were identified, and the paper is ready for publication without the need for major revisions. However, minor improvements in the clarity of certain sections could further enhance the paper's readability.
