Recommendation:
The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of machine learning by introducing a novel method for preserving equivariance in large pretrained models. This contribution is well-supported by rigorous experimental evaluations and clear presentation of results. However, to enhance its publishability, the paper should address several critical weaknesses. Firstly, it should include a more detailed discussion on the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed method, as these are crucial for real-world applications. Secondly, the paper should strengthen its statistical analysis by including confidence intervals and significance tests to validate the superiority of the proposed method over existing techniques. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the paper's robustness and appeal to a broader audience, making it suitable for publication.
