    "recommendation": "The paper is recommended for publication due to its significant contributions to the field of memory optimization in dynamic shape graphs. The introduction of BladeDISC++ and its symbolic shape analysis is a novel approach that addresses a critical gap in existing research. The authors have provided a clear and coherent presentation of their work, supported by robust experimental design and evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of BladeDISC++ in reducing memory consumption and improving performance, which is highly relevant to current challenges in deep learning tasks. No critical weaknesses were identified, and the paper is well-prepared for publication. It is recommended that the authors ensure all technical details are thoroughly checked and that any minor editorial issues are addressed before final submission."
