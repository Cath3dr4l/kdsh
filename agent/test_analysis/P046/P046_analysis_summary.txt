Key Strengths:
- Introduction of a novel concept of symbiotic attacks in GNNs, addressing a significant gap in the literature.
- Demonstrated effectiveness of symbiotic attacks over traditional methods, indicating potential for advancing defenses against adversarial attacks.
- Robust experimental design with evaluations across multiple datasets and GNN architectures.

Critical Weaknesses:
- Lack of comprehensive discussion on the limitations and potential edge cases of the symbiotic attack method.

Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for publication due to its novel contribution to the field of adversarial robustness in Graph Neural Networks and its potential impact on future research. The introduction of symbiotic attacks is a significant advancement, and the robust experimental design supports the validity of the findings. However, to enhance the rigor and balance of the research, it is recommended that the authors include a more comprehensive discussion on the limitations of their method and potential edge cases where the symbiotic attacks might fail. This addition would provide a more nuanced understanding of the applicability and boundaries of their approach.
