    "recommendation": "The paper is deemed publishable due to its innovative approach and significant contributions to the field of healthcare technology, particularly in resource-limited settings. The methodology is robust and addresses a critical gap in existing research, supported by a large and comprehensive dataset. However, to enhance the paper's impact and rigor, it is recommended to include a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the dataset and potential biases that may arise from the data collection process. Additionally, ensuring a consistent level of detail and clarity across all sections, particularly in discussing the implications of the findings, would strengthen the overall presentation. Addressing these points will not only improve the paper's quality but also its applicability in real-world healthcare settings."
