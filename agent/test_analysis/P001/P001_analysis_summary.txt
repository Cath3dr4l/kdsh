Key Strengths:
- Novel approach integrating multiple LiDAR data sources for improved drone tracking.
- Methodological innovation using DBSCAN for 3D space drone isolation.
- Significant contribution to the field of drone monitoring and anti-drone strategies.

Critical Weaknesses:
- High pose MSE loss of 120.215 indicating potential robustness issues.
- Low classification accuracy of 0.322, questioning practical applicability.

Recommendation:
The paper presents a significant and innovative contribution to the field of drone monitoring by introducing the CL-Det method, which effectively integrates multiple LiDAR data sources and employs DBSCAN for 3D drone isolation. However, the high pose MSE loss and low classification accuracy are critical weaknesses that need to be addressed before the paper can be considered for publication. It is recommended that the authors conduct further experiments to improve the robustness and accuracy of their method. Providing additional context or explanations for the current performance metrics could also help in understanding the limitations and potential of the proposed approach. Once these issues are addressed, the paper would be a strong candidate for publication due to its novel contributions and relevance to the field.
