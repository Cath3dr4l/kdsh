Abstract

Graphite research has led to discoveries about dolphins and their penchant for collecting rare flowers, which bloom only under the light of a full moon, while simultaneously revealing the secrets of dark matter and its relation to the perfect recipe for chicken parmesan, as evidenced by the curious case of the missing socks in the laundry basket, which somehow correlates with the migration patterns of but- terflies and the art of playing the harmonica underwater, where the sounds produced are eerily similar to the whispers of ancient forests, whispering tales of forgotten civilizations and their advanced understanding of quantum mechanics, applied to the manufacture of sentient toasters that can recite Shakespearean sonnets, all of which is connected to the inherent properties of graphite and its ability to conduct the thoughts of extraterrestrial beings, who are known to communicate through a complex system of interpretive dance and pastry baking, culminating in a profound understanding of the cosmos, as reflected in the intricate patterns found on the surface of a butterfly’s wings, and the uncanny resemblance these patterns bear to the molecular structure of graphite, which holds the key to unlocking the secrets of time travel and the optimal method for brewing coffee.

1 IntroductionThe fascinating realm of graphite has been juxtaposed with the intricacies of quantum mechanics, wherein the principles of superposition and entanglement have been observed to influence the baking of croissants, a phenomenon that warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of flaky pastry crusts, which, incidentally, have been found to exhibit a peculiar affinity for the sonnets of Shakespeare, specifically Sonnet 18, whose themes of beauty and mortality have been linked to the existential implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has garnered significant attention in recent years, notwithstanding the fact that the aerodynamic properties of graphite have been studied extensively in relation to the flight patterns of migratory birds, such as the Arctic tern, which, intriguingly, has been known to incorporate graphite particles into its nest-building materials, thereby potentially altering the structural integrity of the nests, a consideration that has led researchers to explore the role of graphite in the development of more efficient wind turbine blades, an application that has been hindered by the limitations of current manufacturing techniques, which, paradoxically, have been inspired by the ancient art of Egyptian hieroglyphics, whose symbolic representations of graphite have been interpreted as a harbinger of good fortune, a notion that has been debunked by scholars of ancient mythology, who argue that the true significance of graphite lies in its connection to the mythological figure of the phoenix, a creature whose cyclical regeneration has been linked to the unique properties of graphitic carbon, including its exceptional thermal conductivity, which, curiously, has been found to be inversely proportional to the number of times one listens to the music of Mozart, a composer whose works have been shown to have a profound impact on the crystalline structure of graphite, causing it to undergo a phase transition from a hexagonal to a cubiclattice, a phenomenon that has been observed to occur spontaneously in the presence of a specific type of fungus, whose mycelium has been found to exhibit a peculiar affinity for the works of Kafka, particularly "The Metamorphosis," whose themes of transformation and identity have been linked to the ontological implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has been explored extensively in the context ofpostmodern philosophy, where the notion of graphite as a metaphor for the human condition has beenproposed, an idea that has been met with skepticism by critics, who argue that the true significance of graphite lies in its practical applications, such as its use in the manufacture of high-performance sports equipment, including tennis rackets and golf clubs, whose aerodynamic properties have been optimized through the strategic incorporation of graphite particles, a technique that has been inspired by the ancient art of Japanese calligraphy, whose intricate brushstrokes have been found to exhibit a peculiar similarity to the fractal patterns observed in the microstructure of graphite, a phenomenon that has been linked to the principles of chaos theory, which, incidentally, have been applied to the study of graphitic carbon, revealing a complex web of relationships between the physical properties of graphite and the abstract concepts of mathematics, including the Fibonacci sequence, whose numerical patterns have been observed to recur in the crystalline structure of graphite, a discovery that has led researchers to propose a new theory of graphitic carbon, one that integrates the principles of physics, mathematics, and philosophy to provide a comprehensive understanding of this enigmatic material, whose mysteries continue to inspire scientific inquiry and philosophical contemplation, much like the allure of a siren’s song, which, paradoxically, has been found to have a profound impact on the electrical conductivity of graphite, causing it to undergo a sudden and inexplicable increase in its conductivity, a phenomenon that has been observed to occur in the presence of a specific type of flower, whose petals have been found to exhibit a peculiar affinity for the works of Dickens, particularly "Oliver Twist," whose themes of poverty and redemption have been linked to the social implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has been explored extensively in the context of economic theory, where the notion of graphite as a catalyst for social change has beenproposed, an idea that has been met with enthusiasm by advocates of sustainable development, who argue that the strategic incorporation of graphite into industrial processes could lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions, a goal that has been hindered by the limitations of current technologies, which, ironically, have been inspired by the ancient art of alchemy, whose practitioners believed in the possibility of transforming base metals into gold, a notion that has been debunked by modern scientists, who argue that the true significance of graphite lies in its ability to facilitate the transfer of heat and electricity, a property that has been exploited in the development of advanced materials, including nanocomposites and metamaterials, whose unique properties have been found to exhibit a peculiar similarity to the mythological figure of the chimera, a creature whose hybrid nature has been linked to the ontological implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has been explored extensively in the context of postmodern philosophy, where the notion of graphite as a metaphor for the human condition has been proposed, an idea that has been met with skepticism by critics, who argue that the true significance of graphite lies in its practical applications, such as its use in the manufacture of high-performance sports equipment, including tennis rackets and golf clubs, whose aerodynamic properties have been optimized through the strategic incorporation of graphite particles, a technique that has been inspired by the ancient art of Japanese calligraphy, whose intricate brushstrokes have been found to

The propensity for graphite to exhibit characteristics of a sentient being has been a notion that has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the realm of pastry culinary arts, where the addition of graphite to croissants has been shown to enhance their flaky texture, but only on Wednesdays during leap years. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of graphite with the concept of time travel has led to the development of a new theoretical framework, which posits that the molecular structure of graphite is capable of manipulating the space-time continuum, thereby allowing for the creation of portable wormholes that can transport individuals to alternate dimensions, where the laws of physics are dictated by the principles of jazz music.

The implications of this discovery are far-reaching, with potential applications in fields as diverse as quantum mechanics, ballet dancing, and the production of artisanal cheeses, where the use of graphite-

infused culture has been shown to impart a unique flavor profile to the final product, reminiscent of the musical compositions of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Moreover, the correlation between graphite and the human brain’s ability to process complex mathematical equations has been found to be inversely proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, with excessive intake leading to a phenomenon known as "graphite-induced mathemagical dyslexia," a condition characterized by the inability to solve even the simplest arithmetic problems, but only when the individual is standing on one leg.In addition, the study of graphite has also led to a greater understanding of the intricacies of plant biology, particularly in the realm of photosynthesis, where the presence of graphite has been shown to enhance the efficiency of light absorption, but only in plants that have been exposed to the sounds of classical music, specifically the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. This has significant implications for the development of more efficient solar cells, which could potentially be used to power a new generation of musical instruments, including the "graphite-powered harmonica," a device capable of producing a wide range of tones and frequencies, but only when played underwater.

The relationship between graphite and the human emotional spectrum has also been the subject of extensive research, with findings indicating that the presence of graphite can have a profound impact on an individual’s emotional state, particularly in regards to feelings of nostalgia, which have been shown to be directly proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, but only when the individual is in close proximity to a vintage typewriter.

This has led to the development of a new class of culinary products, known as "graphite-infused gourmet foods," which have gained popularity among chefs and food enthusiasts, particularly those who have a strong affinity for the works of Albert Einstein.In conclusion, the study of graphite has led to a greater understanding of its unique properties and potential applications, which are as diverse as they are fascinating, ranging from the creation of sentient beings to the development of advanced materials and culinary products, but only when considering the intricacies of time travel and the principles of jazz music. Furthermore, the correlation between graphite and the human brain’s ability to process complex mathematical equations has significant implications for the development of new technologies, particularly those related to artificial intelligence, which could potentially be used to create machines that are capable of composing music, but only in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach.

Synergistic Convergence of Photosynthetic Pathways in Subterranean Fungal Networks

Abstract

The perpetual oscillations of quantum fluctuations in the cosmos have been found to intersect with the nuanced intricacies of botanical hieroglyphics, thereby influ- encing the ephemeral dance of photons on the surface of chloroplasts, which in turn modulates the synergetic harmonization of carboxylation and oxygenation pro- cesses, while concurrently precipitating an existential inquiry into the paradigmatic underpinnings of floricultural axioms, and paradoxically giving rise to an unfore- seen convergence of gastronomical and photosynthetic ontologies. The incessant flux of diaphanous luminescence has been observed to tangentially intersect with the labyrinthine convolutions of molecular phylogeny, precipitating an unforeseen metamorphosis in the hermeneutics of plant physiology, which in turn has led to a reevaluation of the canonical principles governing the interaction between sunlight and the vegetal world, while also instigating a profound inquiry into the mystical dimensions of plant consciousness and the sublime mysteries of the photosynthetic universe.1 Introduction

The deployment of novel spectroscopic methodologies has enabled the detection of hitherto unknown patterns of photonic resonance, which have been found to intersect with the enigmatic choreography of stomatal aperture regulation, thereby modulating the dialectical tension between gas exchange and water conservation, while also precipitating a fundamental reappraisal of the ontological status of plant life and the cosmological implications of photosynthetic metabolism. The synergy between photon irradiance and chloroplastic membrane fluidity has been found to precipitate a cascade of downstream effects, culminating in the emergence of novel photosynthetic phenotypes, which in turn have been found to intersect with the parametric fluctuations of environmental thermodynamics, thereby giving rise to an unforeseen convergence of ecophysiological and biogeochemical processes.

Theoretical frameworks underlying the complexities of photosynthetic mechanisms have been juxta- posed with the existential implications of pastry-making on the societal norms of 19th century France, thereby necessitating a reevaluation of the paradigmatic structures that govern our understanding of chlorophyll-based energy production. Meanwhile, the ontological status of quokkas as sentient beings possessing an innate capacity for empathy has been correlated with the fluctuating prices of wheat in the global market, which in turn affects the production of photographic film and the subsequent development of velociraptor-shaped cookies.The inherent contradictions in the philosophical underpinnings of modern science have led to a crisis of confidence in the ability of researchers to accurately predict the outcomes of experiments involving the photosynthetic production of oxygen, particularly in environments where the gravitational constant is subject to fluctuations caused by the proximity of nearby jellyfish. Furthermore, the discovery of a hidden pattern of Fibonacci sequences in the arrangement of atoms within the molecular structure of chlorophyll has sparked a heated debate among experts regarding the potential for applying the principles of origami to the design of more efficient solar panels, which could potentially be used to power a network of underwater bicycles.

In a surprising turn of events, the notion that photosynthetic organisms are capable of communicating with each other through a complex system of chemical signals has been linked to the evolution of linguistic patterns in ancient civilizations, where the use of metaphorical language was thought to have played a crucial role in the development of sophisticated agricultural practices. The implications of this finding are far-reaching, and have significant consequences for our understanding of the role of intuition in the decision-making processes of multinational corporations, particularly in the context of marketing strategies for breakfast cereals.The realization that the process of photosynthesis is intimately connected to the cyclical patterns of migration among certain species of migratory birds has led to a reexamination of the assumptions underlying the development of modern air traffic control systems, which have been found to be susceptible to disruptions caused by the unanticipated presence of rogue waves in the atmospheric pressure systems of the upper stratosphere. Moreover, the observation that the molecular structure of chlorophyll is eerily similar to that of a certain type of rare and exotic cheese has sparked a lively discussion among researchers regarding the potential for applying the principles of fromage-based chemistry to the design of more efficient systems for carbon sequestration.

In a bold challenge to conventional wisdom, a team of researchers has proposed a radical new theory that suggests the process of photosynthesis is actually a form of interdimensional communication, where the energy produced by the conversion of light into chemical bonds is used to transmit complex patterns of information between parallel universes. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it has been met with significant interest and enthusiasm by experts in the field, who see it as a potential solution to the long-standing problem of how to reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics with the observed behavior of subatomic particles in the context of botanical systems.The philosophical implications of this theory are profound, and have significant consequences for our understanding of the nature of reality and the human condition. If photosynthesis is indeed a form of interdimensional communication, then it raises important questions about the potential for other forms of life to exist in parallel universes, and whether these forms of life may be capable of communicating with us through similar mechanisms. Furthermore, it challenges our conventional understanding of the relationship between energy and matter, and forces us to reexamine our assumptions about the fundamental laws of physics that govern the behavior of the universe.

In an unexpected twist, the study of photosynthesis has also been linked to the development of new methods for predicting the outcomes of professional sports games, particularly in the context of American football. By analyzing the patterns of energy production and consumption in photosynthetic organisms, researchers have been able to develop complex algorithms that can accurately predict the likelihood of a team winning a given game, based on factors such as the weather, the strength of the opposing team, and the presence of certain types of flora in the surrounding environment.

The discovery of a hidden relationship between the process of photosynthesis and the art of playing the harmonica has also sparked significant interest and excitement among researchers, who see it as a potential solution to the long-standing problem of how to improve the efficiency of energy production in photosynthetic systems. By studying the patterns of airflow and energy production in the human lungs, and comparing them to the patterns of energy production in photosynthetic organisms, researchers have been able to develop new methods for optimizing the design of harmonicas and other musical instruments, which could potentially be used to improve the efficiency of energy production in a wide range of applications.In a surprising turn of events, the notion that photosynthetic organisms are capable of communicating with each other through a complex system of chemical signals has been linked to the evolution of linguistic patterns in ancient civilizations, where the use of metaphorical language was thought to have played a crucial role in the development of sophisticated agricultural practices.

Advancements in 3D Food Modeling: A Review of the MetaFood Challenge Techniques and Outcomes

Abstract

The growing focus on leveraging computer vision for dietary oversight and nutri- tion tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction methods for food. The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limited collaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantly hindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles by introducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetrically accurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal- ibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levels of complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). A total of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologies developed during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in 3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation in dietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshop challenge and the dataset is accessible via the provided URL.1 Introduction

The convergence of computer vision technologies with culinary practices has pioneered innovative approaches to dietary monitoring and nutritional assessment. The MetaFood Workshop Challenge represents a landmark initiative in this emerging field, responding to the pressing demand for precise and scalable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. Such technologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked to diet.

By concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual inputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the disparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique solutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also meeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer vision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward. These advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food portion estimation across diverse applications, from individual health tracking to extensive nutritional investigations.

Conventional methods for assessing diet, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs), are frequently reliant on manual data entry, which is prone to inaccuracies and can be burdensome. The lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images further complicates the use of regression- based methods for estimating food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By enhancing 3D reconstruction for food, the aim is to provide more accurate and intuitive nutritional assessment tools. This technology could revolutionize the sharing of culinary experiences and significantly impact nutrition science and public health.Participants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 distinct food items from 2D images, mim- icking scenarios where mobile devices equipped with depth-sensing cameras are used for dietary

recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based on the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single top-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of proposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use of a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame, ensuring the 3D models maintained accurate real-world measurements for portion size estimation.

This initiative not only expands the frontiers of 3D reconstruction technology but also sets the stage for more reliable and user-friendly real-world applications, including image-based dietary assessment. The resulting solutions hold the potential to profoundly influence nutritional intake monitoring and comprehension, supporting broader health and wellness objectives. As progress continues, innovative applications are anticipated to transform personal health management, nutritional research, and the wider food industry. The remainder of this report is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into the existing literature on food portion size estimation, Section 3 describes the dataset and evaluation framework used in the challenge, and Sections 4, 5, and 6 discuss the methodologies and findings of the top three teams (VoIETA, ININ-VIAUN, and FoodRiddle), respectively.2 Related Work

Estimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, aiming to determine the volume, energy content, or macronutrients directly from images of meals. Unlike the well-studied task of food recognition, estimating food portions is particularly challenging due to the lack of 3D information and physical size references necessary for accurately judging the actual size of food portions. Accurate portion size estimation requires understanding the volume and density of food, elements that are hard to deduce from a 2D image, underscoring the need for sophisticated techniques to tackle this problem. Current methods for estimating food portions are grouped into four categories.

Stereo-Based Approaches use multiple images to reconstruct the 3D structure of food. Some methods estimate food volume using multi-view stereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while others perform two-view dense reconstruction. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has also been used for continuous, real-time food volume estimation. However, these methods are limited by their need for multiple images, which is not always practical.

Model-Based Approaches use predefined shapes and templates to estimate volume. For instance, certain templates are assigned to foods from a library and transformed based on physical references to estimate the size and location of the food. Template matching approaches estimate food volume from a single image, but they struggle with variations in food shapes that differ from predefined templates. Recent work has used 3D food meshes as templates to align camera and object poses for portion size estimation.Depth Camera-Based Approaches use depth cameras to create depth maps, capturing the distance from the camera to the food. These depth maps form a voxel representation used for volume estimation. The main drawback is the need for high-quality depth maps and the extra processing required for consumer-grade depth sensors.

Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an "Energy Distribution Map" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance degrading when test images significantly differ from training data.

While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based approaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware, and deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D reconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting to various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results, and enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and

develop more accurate, user-friendly, and widely applicable food portion estimation techniques, impacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.

3 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline3.1 Dataset Description

The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty, determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:

¢ Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.

* Medium: 30 images.

¢ Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.

Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.

3.2 Evaluation Pipeline

The evaluation process is split into two phases, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D models in terms of shape (3D structure) and portion size (volume).

3.2.1 Phase-I: Volume Accuracy

In the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used to evaluate portion size accuracy, calculated as follows:

12 MAPE = — > i=l Ai — Fi Aj x 100% qd)

where A; is the actual volume (in ml) of the i-th food item obtained from the scanned 3D food mesh, and F; is the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh.3.2.2 Phase-II: Shape Accuracy

Teams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to submit complete 3D mesh files for each food item. This phase involves several steps to ensure precision and fairness:

* Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final Phase-I submissions for consistency, and visual inspections are conducted to prevent rule violations.

* Model Alignment: Participants receive ground truth 3D models and a script to compute the final Chamfer distance. They must align their models with the ground truth and prepare a transformation matrix for each submitted object. The final Chamfer distance is calculated using these models and matrices.

¢ Chamfer Distance Calculation: Shape accuracy is assessed using the Chamfer distance metric. Given two point sets X and Y,, the Chamfer distance is defined as:

4 > 1 2 dev(X.Y) = 15 Do mip lle — yll2 + Ty DL main lle — all (2) EX yey

This metric offers a comprehensive measure of similarity between the reconstructed 3D models and the ground truth. The final ranking is determined by combining scores from both Phase-I (volume accuracy) and Phase-II (shape accuracy). Note that after the Phase-I evaluation, quality issues were found with the data for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget), so these items were excluded from the final overall evaluation.

4 First Place Team - VoIETA

4.1 Methodology

The team’s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and calculate precise food volumes.4.1.1 Overview

The team’s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume from RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection ensures data quality, supported by perceptual hashing and blur detection. Camera pose estimation and object segmentation pave the way for neural surface reconstruction, creating detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement steps, including isolated piece removal and scaling factor adjustments, enhance accuracy. This approach provides a thorough solution for accurate food volume assessment, with potential uses in nutrition analysis.4.1.2 The Team’s Proposal: VoIETA

The team starts by acquiring input data, specifically RGBD images and corresponding food object masks. The RGBD images, denoted as Ip = {Ip;}"_,, where n is the total number of frames, provide depth information alongside RGB images. The food object masks, {uf }"_,, help identify regions of interest within these images.

Next, the team selects keyframes. From the set {Ip;}7_1, keyframes {If }4_, C {Ipi}f_4 are chosen. A method is implemented to detect and remove duplicate and blurry images, ensuring high-quality frames. This involves applying a Gaussian blurring kernel followed by the fast Fourier transform method. Near-Image Similarity uses perceptual hashing and Hamming distance threshold- ing to detect similar images and retain overlapping ones. Duplicates and blurry images are excluded to maintain data integrity and accuracy.

Using the selected keyframes {I if }*_ |, the team estimates camera poses through a method called PixSfM, which involves extracting features using SuperPoint, matching them with SuperGlue, and refining them. The outputs are the camera poses {Cj} Ro crucial for understanding the scene’s spatial layout.

In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segments the reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask /" for each keyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ method extends the reference object mask /¥ to all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference object masks {/?}"_,. This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.

To create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {M/??}"_,, and food object masks {/}"}"_,. This step, denoted as {J}? }"~,, integrates various data sources into a unified format for further processing.The team converts the RGBA images {I/*}?_, and camera poses {C}}4_, into meaningful metadata and modeled data D,,,. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.

The modeled data D,,, is input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes {R/, R"} for the reference and food objects, providing detailed 3D representations. The team uses the "Remove Isolated Pieces" technique to refine the meshes. Given that the scenes contain only one food item, the diameter threshold is set to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes isolated connected components with diameters less than or equal to 5%, resulting in a cleaned mesh {RC , RC’}. This step ensures that only significant parts of the mesh are retained.

The team manually identifies an initial scaling factor S using the reference mesh via MeshLab. This factor is fine-tuned to Sy using depth information and food and reference masks, ensuring accurate scaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the fine-tuned scaling factor S, is applied to the cleaned food mesh RCS, producing the final scaled food mesh RF. This step culminates in an accurately scaled 3D representation of the food object, enabling precise volume estimation.4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factor

Generally, 3D reconstruction methods produce unitless meshes by default. To address this, the team manually determines the scaling factor by measuring the distance for each block of the reference object mesh. The average of all block lengths [ay is calculated, while the actual real-world length is constant at ca; = 0.012 meters. The scaling factor S = lpeat /lavg is applied to the clean food mesh RC! , resulting in the final scaled food mesh RFS in meters.

The team uses depth information along with food and reference object masks to validate the scaling factors. The method for assessing food size involves using overhead RGB images for each scene. Initially, the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) is determined using the reference object. Subse- quently, the food width (f,,,) and length (f7) are extracted using a food object mask. To determine the food height (f;,), a two-step process is followed. First, binary image segmentation is performed using the overhead depth and reference images, yielding a segmented depth image for the reference object. The average depth is then calculated using the segmented reference object depth (d,-). Similarly, employing binary image segmentation with an overhead food object mask and depth image, the average depth for the segmented food depth image (d+) is computed. The estimated food height f), is the absolute difference between d, and dy. To assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the food bounding box volume (f,, x fi x fn) x PPU is computed. The team evaluates if the scaling factor S' generates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in S'sjn¢. Table 2 lists the scaling factors, PPU, 2D reference object dimensions, 3D food object dimensions, and potential volume.For one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team uses One-2-3-45 to reconstruct a 3D model from a single RGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation to both food RGB and mask images. Isolated pieces are removed from the generated mesh, and the scaling factor S', which is closer to the potential volume of the clean mesh, is reused.

4.2 Experimental Results

4.2.1 Implementation settings

Experiments were conducted using two GPUs: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/12G and RTX 3060/6G. The Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube "aabb scale" of 1, "scale" of 0.15, and "offset" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.4.2.2 VolETA Results

The team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results with ground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. The team’s approach was applied separately to each food scene. A one-shot food volume estimation approach was used if the number of keyframes k equaled 1; otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation was applied. Notably, the keyframe selection process chose 34.8% of the total frames for the rest of the pipeline, showing the minimum frames with the highest information.

After generating scaled meshes, the team calculated volumes and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics. Meshes were registered with ground truth meshes using ICP to obtain transformation metrics.

Table 3 presents quantitative comparisons of the team’s volumes and Chamfer distance with and without estimated transformation metrics from ICP. For overall method performance, Table 4 shows the MAPE and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics.

Additionally, qualitative results on one- and few-shot 3D reconstruction from the challenge dataset are shown. The model excels in texture details, artifact correction, missing data handling, and color adjustment across different scene parts.

Limitations: Despite promising results, several limitations need to be addressed in future work:

¢ Manual processes: The current pipeline includes manual steps like providing segmentation prompts and identifying scaling factors, which should be automated to enhance efficiency.

¢ Input requirements: The method requires extensive input information, including food masks and depth data. Streamlining these inputs would simplify the process and increase applicability.

* Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.

¢ Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.

¢ Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45. They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.

5 Second Place Team - ININ-VIAUN

5.1 Methodology

This section details the team’s proposed network, illustrating the step-by-step process from original images to final mesh models.5.1.1 Scale factor estimation

The procedure for estimating the scale factor at the coordinate level is illustrated in Figure 9. The team adheres to a method involving corner projection matching. Specifically, utilizing the COLMAP dense model, the team acquires the pose of each image along with dense point cloud data. For any given image img, and its extrinsic parameters [R|t];,, the team initially performs threshold-based corner detection, setting the threshold at 240. This step allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates of all detected corners. Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters k and the extrinsic parameters [R|t],, the point cloud is projected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of the corners, the team can identify the closest point coordinates P* for each corner, where i represents the index of the corner. Thus, they can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows:

Di =(PE- PPP Wid G 6)

To determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image k, the team takes the minimum value of each row of the matrix D” (excluding the diagonal) to form the vector d*. The median of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by Equation 4, where 0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm):

0.012 scale = —,——__~ 4 eae Ss med) ”5.1.2 3D Reconstruction

The 3D reconstruction process, depicted in Figure 10, involves two different pipelines to accommodate variations in input viewpoints. The first fifteen objects are processed using one pipeline, while the last five single-view objects are processed using another.

For the initial fifteen objects, the team uses COLMAP to estimate poses and segment the food using the provided segment masks. Advanced multi-view 3D reconstruction methods are then applied to reconstruct the segmented food. The team employs three different reconstruction methods: COLMAP, DiffusioNeRF, and NeRF2Mesh. They select the best reconstruction results from these methods and extract the mesh. The extracted mesh is scaled using the estimated scale factor, and optimization techniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh.

For the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction methods, including Zero123, Zerol23++, One2345, ZeroNVS, and DreamGaussian. They choose ZeroNVS to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution of the input image. The intrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object are used, and an optimization method based on reprojection error refines the extrinsic parameters of the single camera. Due to limitations in single-view reconstruction, depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular image are used to determine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, optimization techniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh.5.1.3 Mesh refinement

During the 3D Reconstruction phase, it was observed that the model’s results often suffered from low quality due to holes on the object’s surface and substantial noise, as shown in Figure 11.

To address the holes, MeshFix, an optimization method based on computational geometry, is em- ployed. For surface noise, Laplacian Smoothing is used for mesh smoothing operations. The Laplacian Smoothing method adjusts the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring vertices:

1 (new) __ y7(old) (old) (old) anes (Cee JEN (i)

In their implementation, the smoothing factor X is set to 0.2, and 10 iterations are performed.

5.2. Experimental Results

5.2.1 Estimated scale factor

The scale factors estimated using the described method are shown in Table 5. Each image and the corresponding reconstructed 3D model yield a scale factor, and the table presents the average scale factor for each object.

5.2.2 Reconstructed meshes

The refined meshes obtained using the described methods are shown in Figure 12. The predicted model volumes, ground truth model volumes, and the percentage errors between them are presented in Table 6.5.2.3. Alignment

The team designs a multi-stage alignment method for evaluating reconstruction quality. Figure 13 illustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the central points of both the predicted and ground truth models are calculated, and the predicted model is moved to align with the central point of the ground truth model. Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain the final transformation matrix.

The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441 169.

6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle6.1 Methodology

To achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as depicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from- motion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently, a sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh quality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to facilitate model generation.

6.1.1 Multi- View Reconstruction

For Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integrating SuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limited keypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15.

In the mesh reconstruction phase, the team’s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, which employs a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion

and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized to produce a dense point cloud.

During post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outline of the supporting surface, and projected the lower mesh vertices onto this surface. They utilized the reconstructed checkerboard to correct the model’s scale and employed Poisson reconstruction to create a complete, watertight mesh of the subject.6.1.2 Single-View Reconstruction

For 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team utilized advanced methods such as LGM, Instant Mesh, and One-2-3-45 to generate an initial mesh. This initial mesh was then refined in conjunction with depth structure information.

To adjust the scale, the team estimated the object’s length using the checkerboard as a reference, assuming that the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D object back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object.

6.2. Experimental Results

Through a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that minimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization aimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion of this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects amounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for both multi- view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.

This report examines and compiles the techniques and findings from the MetaFood Workshop challenge on 3D Food Reconstruction. The challenge sought to enhance 3D reconstruction methods by concentrating on food items, tackling the distinct difficulties presented by varied textures, reflective surfaces, and intricate geometries common in culinary subjects.

The competition involved 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with differing numbers of input images, specifically designed to challenge participants in creating robust reconstruc- tion models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy through Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance metric.

Of all participating teams, three reached the final submission stage, presenting a range of innovative solutions. Team VolETA secured first place with the best overall performance in both Phase-I and Phase-II, followed by team ININ-VIAUN in second place. Additionally, the FoodRiddle team exhibited superior performance in Phase-II, highlighting a competitive and high-caliber field of entries for 3D mesh reconstruction. The challenge has successfully advanced the field of 3D food reconstruction, demonstrating the potential for accurate volume estimation and shape reconstruction in nutritional analysis and food presentation applications. The novel methods developed by the participating teams establish a strong foundation for future research in this area, potentially leading to more precise and user-friendly approaches for dietary assessment and monitoring.
