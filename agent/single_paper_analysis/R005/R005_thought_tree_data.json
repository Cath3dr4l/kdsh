This includes a robust discussion on the significance of the findings in the broader context of dance therapy and human-computer interaction. Secondly, the methodology section requires substantial enhancement to ensure rigor and reproducibility. The authors should provide detailed descriptions of the experimental controls and statistical analyses used to validate the findings. Addressing the ambiguity in the methodology, particularly regarding 'Cross-Cultural Gesture Drift,' is crucial to establish the reliability of the results. By addressing these critical weaknesses, the paper could significantly improve its chances of being published and making a meaningful contribution to the literature."
